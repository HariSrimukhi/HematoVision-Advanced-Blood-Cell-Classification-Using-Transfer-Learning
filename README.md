# 🧬 HematoVision: Advanced Blood Cell Classification Using Transfer Learning

HematoVision is a deep learning web application that classifies microscopic blood cell images into four types:
- Eosinophil
- Lymphocyte
- Monocyte
- Neutrophil

It uses **Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2)** for high accuracy and is built with **Flask** for a simple, interactive web interface.
